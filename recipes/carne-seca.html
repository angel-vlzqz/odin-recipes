    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Carne-seca ('dried meat' in spanish) is a kind of dried, salted meat, usually beef.
        Carne seca is a frequent accompaniment to hot sauce and onions.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds venison</li>
        <li>Juice of 3 to 4 limes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fine-grained salt</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons dried, ground chiles or paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the meat to about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Remove any excess fat. </li>
        <li>Moisten the meat with the lime juice. Mix the salt and chiles together and coat every slice of venison with it. 
            Press the mixture into the meat. Let this set in the fridge for at least 8 hours and up to 3 days. 
        </li>
        <li>Lay the meat out in one layer on the grates of a smoker or dehydrator. Smoke at 165F or dehydrate at 145F until 
            the meat is dry, about 2 to 4 hours. Pull it when it's pliable if you want to eat it within a week or two, and 
            dry it brittle if you want it to keep for a long time, or make machaca. </li>
    </ol>
