    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>These Quesabirria tacos are made up of tender birria meat and melted cheese, wrapped in a crispy pan-seared 
        tortilla! Made in just one pot and minimal prep required, use the meat to make birria tacos too!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>For the birria meat: </p>
        <li>Dried ancho chiles– Red poblano chiles that have been dried out. These can be found at specialty grocery stores or in the 
            Mexican food aisle of the supermarket. </li>
        <li>Mexican chiles– New Mexico chiles are preferred, but jalapeno peppers or chipotle peppers can also be used. </li>
        <li>Onion and tomato– Quartered to allow them to soften through the cooking process. </li>
        <li>Garlic– Whole cloves. </li>
        <li>Beef broth– A good quality beef broth makes all the difference, so avoid bouillon cubes and use freshly made broth. </li>
        <li>Vegetable oil– To brown the beef. </li>
        <li>Beef chuck roast– A slightly fattier cut of beef which falls apart once cooked (and soaks up all the flavors!). Cut
             your beef into 1-inch cubes.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper– To taste. </li>
        <li>Apple cider vinegar– Balances out the salty flavors. </li>
        <li>Cumin– Adds a light, smoky flavor. </li>
        <li>Coriander– Adds a subtle tartness and a must for any stewed or slow cooked meat. </li>
        <li>Bay leaves– Adds an extra layer of flavor to the dish.  </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <p>For the quessabirria tacos:</p>
        <li>Tortillas– Either store bought corn tortillas or for a low carb option, keto tortillas. </li>
        <li>Shredded cheese– Oaxaca cheese is preferred, as it is more authentic, but mozzarella works in a pinch. </li>
        <li>Cilantro– Freshly chopped, to serve. </li>
        <li>Condiments– Salsa, guacamole, and fresh limes. For a more traditional dish, serve it with some consomme. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by adding the chiles, onion, tomato, garlic, and beef broth into a large pot and placing it over medium heat. 
            Bring it a boil then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>While the broth mixture is simmering, prepare the beef. Add the oil to a Dutch oven and once hot, 
            sear the beef on all sides until no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Next, remove the liquid mixture from the heat. Using a stick blender, puree everything together until smooth, then 
            add it to the Dutch oven. </li>
        <li>Add the salt, pepper, apple cider vinegar, coriander, and bay leaves and bring everything
             to a simmer. </li>
        <li>Once simmering, remove from the heat and transfer it into a preheated oven and cook for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Now, once the birria beef is done in the oven, remove it and shred the meat with two forks before assembling into 
            quesabirria tacos. </li>
        <li>Place the tortillas onto a flat surface and generously fill one side with the birria meat.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded cheese and a sprinkling of cilantro and fold in half.</li>
        <li>Place a large non-stick pan over medium heat. 
            Once hot, add the folded tortillas to the pan and cook for a minute each side, or until golden and sizzling.</li>
    </ol>
