    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Menudo is often referred to as a cure for all hangovers, which is unsurprising considering its hearty, rustic, and spicy flavors.
         It is common to accompany the soup with some corn tortillas for dipping, garnish it with lime wedges, and serve it hot,
          preferably in large bowls.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>For the broth:</p>
        <li>3 pounds of clean tripe cut into small bite size pieces</li>
        <li>1 cow’s feet It’s usually sold already cut up in pieces</li>
        <li>1 pound marrow bones</li>
        <li>4 large garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 medium onion cut into thick slices</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoon salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dry oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <p>For the sauce:</p>
        <li>6 guajillo peppers cleaned seeded, open flat, and deveined</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of freshly ground cumin optional</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <p>For the garnishing:</p>
        <li>1 Tbsp. Piquin peppers crushed to add when serving if you like hot food.</li>
        <li>Lemons cut into wedges</li>
        <li>Dry Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>¾ cup white onion chopped</li>
        <li>To be eaten with warm corn tortillas.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Simmer the cow feet and marrow bones in a large pot with 6 quarts of water, 4 garlic cloves and an onion for about 15 minutes
             at medium heat without covering. During this time, skim off the foam that forms. Add the tripe and oregano and cook for about
              2 – 2 ½ hours approximately until tripe is tender but firm (make sure you do not overcook). For the INSTANT POT, cook for 30
               minutes. For a Pressure cooker 45 minutes.  You could also use a slow cooker and set it in low for 6 hrs.</li>
        <li>Remove the cow feet and marrow bones from the pot. Skim the fat that forms on top of the broth. Once the Cow foot cools a 
            little, remove the bones and chop the meaty parts of to be returned to the pot.</li>
        <li>While the meat is cooking, prepare the guajillo sauce. Toast the Guajillo peppers in a griddle over medium heat. Press them
             down with a spatula slightly toasting them without burning them.</li>
        <li>Place the roasted peppers in a bowl and cover with water. Let them soak for about 25 minutes until soft. After that, 
            drain the peppers and place them in your blender with 3 garlic cloves, ½ cup of the broth, and cumin if using. Blend
             until very smooth. Strain the sauce using a sieve and pour into the pot. Simmer the broth for another 30 minutes, 
             partially covered. Taste to season with more salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the soup in large bowls and place the garnishes in a dish in order for everyone to add to their liking. Do not forget 
            warm corn tortillas to soak in the broth.</li>
    </ol>
