    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Menudo is often referred to as a cure for all hangovers, which is unsurprising considering its hearty, rustic, and spicy flavors.
         It is common to accompany the soup with some corn tortillas for dipping, garnish it with lime wedges, and serve it hot,
          preferably in large bowls.</p>
